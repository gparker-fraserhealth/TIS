ChatGPT instruction:

Hello, I need to collect some statistics for Windows servers and aggregate them. Can you please help me write a powershell script as follows:
- given a list of server names, logs into each one with a common user/name password
- collects the server's current RAM usage and maximum, current disk usage (all disk drives) and maximum, and current RAM usage and maximum
- records the current date/time the stats are taken
- repeats every 15 minutes, between the hours of 10am and 6pm
- adds these values, including the name of the server to a list
- at the end of each iteration, appends the list to a .CSV file
- the name of the .CSV file is provided as a command line argument
- the lists of servers are provided in a separate text file, line by line, with the name of that file provided as a command line argument
- during execution, each major step and errors are logged to a log file. The log file will be named "log.log" and will save to the same directory as the executable.
